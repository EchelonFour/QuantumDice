QuantumDice
===========
A random number generator for the android platform that sources it's randomness from quantum events. This allows for decisions to be made based off non-determinate data.
The quantum randomness is sourced from http://qrng.anu.edu.au/ and their FAQ does a much better job of explaining why these numbers are truly random.
